A program computes in either sensitive and non-sensitive data and follows a specific flow, from data sources to data sinks.
Data leakage happens when sensitive data is sent to unauthorized data sinks, to prevent that, Dynamic and Static Flow Enforcement 
techniques ensure that sensitive data reaches those sinks. To prevent data leakage, 
these methods rely on a list of sensitive data sources and data sinks, this list is hand annotated and is impractical to be made to a huge API such as Android. 
With that in mind, a machine learning model is used to classify methods into sources and sinks. 
The present work intends to extend the previous work creating a dataset to evaluate the most used classification algorithms and define which is the most suitable to this problem.
