The information leakage is a big concern of mobile users and developers, there are many security systems and tools that uses taint tracking to identify unwanted information flow into a IoT and mobile application. These tools need a precise list of sources and sinks methods to detect malicious flows. This is solved using classification algorithms to generate this list, focusing in maximize the quantity of true positives and false negatives leakage.

The problem of categorize Android API methods come along with some difficulties: the lack of substantiated databases, lack of precise public information about the methods in APIs and the big variety of APIs available to Android. This work provides a database to develop classification strategies and increase the performance of information tracking systems.

We can conclude that the MLP is the best classifier to categorize Android methods, based on overall and per class performance, it has scored better results in almost all metrics by class and overall. Also, that other classifiers can be used as alternative to the MLP, such as METADES with Decision Tree and Linear SVM. These classification algorithms are at the same baseline value, the precision difference between MLP and METADES using Decision Tree is 0.011 and recall of just 0.0089, indicating that a simpler algorithm can solve the problem.
