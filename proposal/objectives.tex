\chapter{Objectives}
This work has two main objectives: generate a public database containing methods from Android APIs and evaluate the 
performance of the most used classification algorithms on this database. The methods should be classified into any 
of the two Flow Classes, source or sink, or neither.

The motivation behind the database creation comes when \cite{rasthofer2014machine} developed the initial 
classification work. Their objective were create a machine-learning solution to identify sources and sink methods 
from the code of any Android API. So, every time that you wanted to test other classification algorithms, you had 
to extract the methods and features at every execution. Then, create a public database extract knowledge and 
develop better solutions to this problem is very likely.

The objective of evaluate different classification algorithms comes as \cite{rasthofer2014machine} shows results 
for only three classification algorithms, SVM, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. From that, emerged the question if 
other classification algorithms have better results in this database. So, the second objective is to evaluate the 
most used classifiers in the literature, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, MLP, KNN, including ensemble 
classifications methods.
